## Description
Browser-based “Course Roster & Assignments Manager” that demonstrates confident use of arrays (creation and mutation with modern methods), iteration patterns, and objects with methods. 

## Scope and constraints
Allowed concepts: arrays and array methods, iteration patterns (for, for…of, forEach, map, filter, find, some, every), objects with properties and methods, variables, conditionals, operators, console I/O (console.log, alert, prompt, confirm), string/number conversion as needed.
Recommended: ensure alphabetical sorting is correct and predictable; use defensive checks for inputs; be aware of when you mutate vs. return new arrays.
Out of scope: classes, external libraries, persistent storage, asynchronous code, frameworks (React/Vue/etc.). Keep the focus on arrays, iterations, and objects. You may reuse fundamentals from Homework 1 (variables, conditionals, operators) to validate inputs and control flow.
